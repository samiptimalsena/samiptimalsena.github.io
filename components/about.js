            Hi! I am Samip Timalsena, a 3rd year Undergraduate student at Kathmandu University(KU). 
            Talking about my coding journey, I started with web development. After learning some basics of JavaScript, i started doing projects in MERN stack. 
            I made some interesting projects in MERN like cloning Spotify music app, a fully functional e-commerece app. Thenafter, i shifted towards mobile app development. I chose flutter and started doing projects in it.
            In flutter i made some cool apps like <i>Sasto Bazaar</i> which is also an e-commerce app, Covid-19 tracker, <i>Guru</i> which is a mobile app that provides online platform to study. After some years of coding journey, i started to learn maths behind Machine Learning(ML). Soon I developed my passion towards it. 
            Visualizing the data and finding relation in them excited me more. The never ending learning journey in data science field is what i love. I dream to bring some positive changes in our Nepalese Society with AI.
